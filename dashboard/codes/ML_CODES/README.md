# Speech_emotion_recognition_BLSTM

Bidirectional LSTM network for speech emotion recognition.

Environment:

- Python 2.7/3.6
- NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1060 6GB
- Conda version 4.5

# Dependencies

- [Tensorflow(1.6)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.6) for the backend of keras
- [keras(2.1.5)](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) for building/training the Bidirectional LSTM network
- [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) for audio resampling
- [pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis) for feature engineering
- [scikit learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) for k-fold cross validation
- [Hyperas](https://github.com/maxpumperla/hyperas) for fine-tuning hyper parameters and find best model
- [webrtcvad](https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad) for sentence extraction
- [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) for wav extraction

# Datasets

- [Berlin speech dataset](http://emodb.bilderbar.info/download/)

# Usage

- Since the function "stFeatureSpeed" in pyAudioAnalysis is default unworkable, you have to modify the code in audioFeatureExtraction.py (for index related issue, just cast the value type to integer; for the issue in method stHarmonic, cast M to integer(M = int(M); Comment out the invocation of method 'mfccInitFilterBanks' in stFeatureSpeed).
- If you run the code in python 3, please upgrade pyAudioAnalysis to the latest version that compatible with python 3.
- You have to prepare at least two different sets of data, one for find the best model and the other for testing.

Long option | Option | Description
----------- | ------ | -----------
--dataset | -d | dataset type
--dataset_path | -p | dataset or the predicted data path
--load_data | -l | load dataset and dump the data stream to a .p file
--feature_extract | -e | extract features from data and dump to a .p file
--model_path | -m | the model path you want to load
--nb_classes | -c | the number of classes of your data
--speaker_indipendence | -s | cross validation is made using different actors for train and test sets

Example find_best_model.py:

    python find_best_model.py -d "berlin" -p [berlin data path] -l -e -c 7

- The first time you run the script, -l and -e options are mandatory since you need to load data and extract features.
- Every time you change the training data and/or the method of feature engineering, you have to specify -l and/or -e respectively to update your .p files.
- You can also modify the code for tuning other hyper parameters.

Example prediction.py:

    python prediction.py -p [data path] -m [model path] -c 7

Example model_cross_validation.py:

    python model_cross_validation.py -d "berlin" -p [berlin data path] -l -e -c 7

- Use -s for k-fold cross validation in different actors.

# Experimental result

- Use hyperas for tuning optimizers, batch_size and epochs, the remaining parameters are the values applied to the paper below.
- The average accuracy is about 68.60%(+/- 1.88%, through 10-fold cross validation, using Berlin dataset).

# Future work

- The training data I list above (Berlin) may insufficient, the validation accuracy and loss can't be improved while the training result is not good.
- Given sufficient training examples, the parameters of short-term characterization, long-term aggregation, and the attention model can be jointly optimized for best performance.
- Update the current network architecture to improve the accuracy (already in progress).
